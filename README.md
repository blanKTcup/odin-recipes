# odin-recipes
Odin Project recipes project 
In this project I will be creating a website that lists some of my favorite recipes and pages that go into more detail regarding the recipes. I actually did not fill out the recipes because its just writing out words. Regarding the testing of my HTML knowledge, this was fairly simple and not as complex as the freecodecamp cat photo app that I also completed.
